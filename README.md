# CAiO (WIP)

I know, I know...the italian word is spelt "ciao"...relax.

CAiO (Chat-Ai-Offline/Ollama) is a hobby project designed to experiment with new React technologies and UI techniques. While there are many chat interfaces available, this project serves as a playground for innovation and learning.
